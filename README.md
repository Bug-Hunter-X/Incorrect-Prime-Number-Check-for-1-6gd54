# Incorrect Prime Number Check for 1

This repository demonstrates a common error in primality testing functions: incorrectly handling the number 1.

The `bug.js` file contains a function `checkIfPrime` which is mostly correct but fails for the input `1`.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected version.
